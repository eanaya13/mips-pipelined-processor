# MIPS Pipelined Processor Simulation

This project simulates a 5-stage pipelined MIPS processor in Verilog. It includes:

- Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write-Back stages
- Hazard Detection Unit (data/control hazards)
- Forwarding logic to avoid stalls
- Waveform simulations using ModelSim
